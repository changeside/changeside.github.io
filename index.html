                <h2>Video Game Projects</h2>
                <p>"Anjellyca" as well as "Monster Princess" are student projects created in the effort to learn game development.
                    These games were created with 4 person teams in the span of one Semester.
                    In both these titles I served as the main programmer of the team, and all the assets created by me are respectively listed on
                    their dedicated pages.<br>
                    If you are feeling a bit adventurous why not give them a try?
                </p><br><h1>SSP</h1>
                <!--SSP explanation-->
                <h2>What are Ukagaka even?</h2>
                <p>This page lists Ghosts/Ukagaka I have made or participated in over the years. They run on the baseware <i>SakuraScriptPlayer</i> and utilize <i>Yaya</i> as language.<br>
                    Ukagaka are in their essence japanese Desktop Buddies.
                    If you don't know what that means- let me explain. They are little characters displayed on your screen that can do various things.
                    For example, emptying your recycle bin, tracking time, setting alarms or even serving as tasklists. Or something as simple as being a dress up game. 
                    Most however are supposed to entertain by providing company to the user and having lots of dialogue as well as interactions.
                    <br>If you're intrigued, be sure to check out the webring on the left and test out some Ukagaka!

                <!--SSP install section-->
                <h2>How to install SSP (On Windows)</h2>
                <p> 1. Install from the <a href="http://ssp.shillest.net/">official website</a><br>
                    2. Open SSP.exe<br>
                    3. Right click and click "English" under "Language". Restart.<br>
                    4. Now you can drag any ghost onto the start up one and they'll automatically install.
                </p>
                <h2>How to install SSP (On Mac/Other OS)</h2>
                <p>As SSP is intended to be run on Windows and I only own devices with Windows,
                    I cannot detail the workarounds used properly to run it on different OS, so please drop into the 
                    <a href="http://discord.gg/uBPq8XF">Ukagaka Server</a> and look for resources. 
                    Thanks for your understanding.</p>

                <p><i>Ever wanted to be foulmouthed by your favorite edgy skeleton?</i></p>
                <p>
                    Well, now your time has come! He can lounge around your desktop, <s>blast your favorite music in a handy included music player</s> (due to sudden changes in behavior of the code this became unavailable), 
                    empty your recycle bin, tell you a bunch of terrible jokes, the current time or little alarms you can set for yourself, 
                    speak to you, learn about as well as react to your actions and much much more.<br>
                    He is of course, based on my own headcanons (but watered down to appeal to more people), instead of official designs.
                    Sans also features animations, that can however be turned off after the first boot!<br>
    
                    <br><b>THIS IS AN HONEST WARNING!</b> Underfell Sans swears, curses you out depending on your relationship with him and features <b>extremely</b> dark and tasteless jokes.<br>
                    They are <b>off by default</b> but can individually by topic be turned on in the settings menu.
                    If jokes overlap multiple topics they will be disabled as soon as a single one of the related topics is disabled to avoid accidentally triggering the user.
                    <br>The setting of this Ukagaka's universe is really really dark.
                    While the hostility towards the user goes away over time when you befriend him, most of the dark topics never fully leave.
                    <br><b>As such if violence, swearing or cursing are upsetting to you please refrain from trying him out, he will not be enjoyable for you.</b>

                        Art, animation, coding and most of the dialogue was done entirely by me. Any helpers for bugfixing and dialogue are credited in the ghost. 
                        The following utility functions are through plugins that were provided by really amazing coders from the Ukagaka community: Empty recycle bin.

                    Snail is just a little bean that can hang around your desktop and try on many different clothing combinations! 
                    You may even get her to ramble about her interests like a couple curious rock facts perhaps? 
                    Maybe watch her sing to herself? Galla, Misu and me made her over the course of a week for an event, 
                    but afterwards decided to smooth out her errors and add more clothing items.
